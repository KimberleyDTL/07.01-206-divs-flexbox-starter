                <p>I currently reside in Port Perry, ON, Canada, a small town about an hour's drive north-east of Toronto.  But I was born on the east coast of Canada and spent my early years in Quebec and high school years in Eastern Ontario.  Though I do hope to remain put, I would love to visit western Canada and see more of Northern Ontario.</p>

                <p><span>My Passion:</span>  It's so difficult to narrow it down to one as there are so many things I love!  I will say that crafting is something that truly makes me happy.  The art of creating something of nothing gives me a deep sense of satisfaction and pride. But...if you were to ask anybody I know, animals are really my true love.  Especially my kitties!</p>

                <p><span>Fun Fact:</span> Cats have more than 100 sounds in their vocal repertoire. &#40;Dogs only have about 10.&#41;</p>
